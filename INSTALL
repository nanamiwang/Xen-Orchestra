Server Requirements:
- Apache
- php5 + php5-xmlrpc
- joinable Dom0 RPC daemon, see the README

1) Make sure that:
   - the folder this file is in and all the files inside are readable by you web
     server;
   - the "htdocs" directory is accessible through your web server;
   - PHP 5 is correctly configured with the following extension:
     * XML-RPC,
	 * a PDO driver (mandatory for advanced user management),
     * the command line interpreter (mandatory for the installation scripts) .

2) Copy "xen-orchestra.conf.dist" to "xen-orchestra.conf" and edit it accordingly
   to your configuration.

3) If you are using users management:
   - check if there is an SQL script for your database in the "sql" directory;
   - if there is not, write one yourself drawing inspiration from existing ones,
   - execute it (you can use the "exec-sql-script" script in the "scripts"
     directory),
   - finally, you can create users with the "create-user" script.

4) Now you can at last open your web browser and start using it.
